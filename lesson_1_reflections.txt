How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?
  Viewing a diff allowed me to figure out which lines were added and
  which lines were deleted.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  I can go back to previous versions even if I mess up somewhere during
  the process.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs does?
  Manually saving lets me keep track of the important changes, while
  automatic changes helps me keep track of changes even when I forget
  to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?
  Saving multiple files is efficient when all of the files are
  interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?
  Using git log and git diff helps me know which changes were made in
  which files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
that could break something?
  I can go back and forth between changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using
Git for?
  Everything!!!
