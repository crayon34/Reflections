When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want other people to look at your work and help you work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want some changes made by others on GitHub, so manually pulling changes allows you to pick and choose the changes you want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking allows me to copy a repository from somewhere on github to another place on github. Forking is useful when I'm getting repositories from others' accounts.
Clones are copies of repositories that do not have to be on github; for example, this is useful when I'm cloning a repository onto my local device from github.
Finally, branches are different versions of one repository, usually created to experiment with different changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that you can work with the latest version even when you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using Git or GitHub, I would have to send my files manually to my partners for every change I make, with specific notes on what I changed.
That would be more time-consuming and painstaking.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I'm trying to make multiple changes at once, it is more helpful to make each change in a separate branch rather than putting all of them in master at once.
