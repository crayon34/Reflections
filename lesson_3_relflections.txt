When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want other people to look at your work and help you work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want some changes made by others on GitHub, so manually pulling changes allows you to pick and choose the changes you want.
